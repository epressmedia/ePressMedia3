Termination of Search Module (Justin Lee)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Search Dir and Pages have been terminated since 3.2. No Support will be provided in this module. Instead, the controls are available in the controls/search folder.
These controls can be attached to a custom page with various parameters. It will give admin users the ability to customize and build their own search page. 
Of course, the looking of the pages can be updated by adding more CSS code.
